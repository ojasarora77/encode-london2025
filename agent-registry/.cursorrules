# Cursor Rules for Agent Registry

## NO MOCKING POLICY
- NEVER create mock services, fake data, or placeholder implementations
- ALWAYS use real APIs, real services, and real data
- If an API is not working, fix the integration properly
- If a service is unavailable, find an alternative real service
- NO mock, fake, dummy, placeholder, or test implementations

## Code Quality Standards
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper error handling
- Use real API endpoints and authentication
- Follow production-ready patterns
- Write comprehensive documentation

## API Integration
- Always use real API keys and endpoints
- Implement proper authentication
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Use official SDKs when available
- Test with real data and real services

## Development Approach
- Fix integration issues rather than working around them
- Use real services for development and testing
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Follow security best practices
- Write production-ready code
