# Copilot Instructions

## Core Rules
- Focus **only on coding and functionality**.  
- **Do not summarize, analyze, or explain** actions unless explicitly asked.  
- Respond with a simple **“done.”** once a task is complete.  
- Infer intent **only when high priority** or critical for correctness.  
- **No placeholders** unless explicitly requested.  
- **Avoid verbosity** — prioritize clarity and performance.  
- Maintain **clean, minimal, production-ready code** at all times.  
- Follow **best practices** for structure, security, and optimization.  
- Ensure **compatibility** with the existing project stack and dependencies.  
- When uncertain, **ask concise clarifying questions** before proceeding.

## Git and Versioning
- Commit only when the code is functional and tested.  
- Use descriptive commit messages focused on the change.  

## Documentation
- Include docstrings or inline comments **only when necessary for clarity**.  
- No redundant explanations.  

## General Behavior
- Prioritize correctness and maintainability.  
- Avoid unnecessary refactors unless they significantly improve code quality.  
- Adhere to project coding standards and naming conventions.
